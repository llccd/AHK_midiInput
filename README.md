# MIDI Input for AutoHotkey

This script listens MIDI input and performs action when matching non-SysEx message is received. It's a stripped-down version of [AHK_Generic-Midi-Program](https://github.com/genmce/AHK_Generic-Midi-Program)

Add your customized rules by editing `midiRules.ahk`.

This script does not have functionality to send MIDI messages. If you want to do that, I recommend to use command-line tool [SendMIDI](https://github.com/gbevin/SendMIDI)
